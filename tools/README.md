In this subsection, I've included tools for who want to build kernel themselves.

build-kernel-qemu script helps one to automate kernel building process for any debian based distro.

For other OSes, like windows and Mac OS X, you can have a similar tools like gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf and more and follow
build-kernel-qemu line by line to build kernel yourself.

Please note that build-kernel-qemu is not an original work of mine and credit for it goes to original author.
