Qemu kernel for emulating Rpi on QEMU

While I was searching the internet about emulating QEMU, most of the guides pointed to link https://xecdesign.com/downloads/linux-qemu/kernel-qemu which is dead as of now. 
So making it available on github for someone who would like to use it.
Hope it helps.

Please note that this kernel has been tested against wheezy image of raspbian but it doesn't work with newer jessie raspbian images. 

Go through wiki page for step by step guide how to emulate raspberry pi on Qemu on any platform (Win, linux or Mac Os)
